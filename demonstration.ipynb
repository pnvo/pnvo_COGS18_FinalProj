    "\n",
    "I just recently got into finances; managing my own money, investing here and there, so I wanted to work on a finance \n",
    "related project for our classes' final. The concept was a little bit more complex than what I was expecting, but I \n",
    "learned a lot and got to reinforce what we learned throughout the course greatly. I turned to StackOverflow and GitHub \n",
    "for directions on where to go and how I should approach certain tasks, but all of the code in this project is mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, some things may not be as smooth as they could be; I didn't understand a lot of the jargon that \n",
    "was thrown around while I was researching, but I managed to get everything to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported features:\n",
    "    Basic:\n",
    "        Create a user profile\n",
    "        Create accounts to store money\n",
    "        Withdrawing, depositing money from existing accounts \n",
    "        Showing your balances\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Not-so-basic:\n",
    "        Calculating compound interest rate over time period and rate given a certain account \n",
    "        Loading/saving user profiles (This was by far the most confusing part for me.)\n",

    "How to run:\n",

    "The application itself can be run in your terminal by: python3 main.py. The application runs a \"while True:\" loop that\n",
    "keeps fetching user input and prompting them accordingly. I made a lot of unit/integration tests inside of:\n",
    "'local_testing.py' but there may be a few edge cases that I missed. This notebook will show some of the features \n",
    "that I implemented. You can see how everything works by examining the 'utilities' folder. 'main.py' is the actual \n",
    "thing that runs the 'application' code, which creates user objects and saves them in json files inside of '/data/'\n",
    "\n",
    "With the way the files are loaded, you don't need to import anything. It's meant to be a terminal application; simply\n",
    "put '%run main.py' inside of Jupyter and it'll start prompting you. \n",
